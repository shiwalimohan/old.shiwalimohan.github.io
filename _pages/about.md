I am an AI researcher at [SRI International] (https://www.sri.com/). I build intelligent interactive systems that model, learn, and reason about their human collaborators. My research advances methods for complex sequential decision making, intelligent agent systems, as well as hybrid AI architectures built with statistical machine learning and knowledge-rich inference algorithms. I leverage insights from economics, psychology, education, and HCI to desgin effective and robust human-agent collaboration in real-world settings. 

I am a Principal Investigator at SRI and lead technology and business development for AI research. My work spans fundamental algorithmic advances as well applications of AI. 

**Fundamental AI**: I lead research on open-world learning agents ([DARPA SAIL-ON] (https://intelligencecommunitynews.com/darpa-introduces-sail-on-program/)) and on teachable agents ([DARPA GAILA] (https://www.darpa.mil/program/grounded-artificial-intelligence-language-acquisition)). Both these efforts study how agents can adapt to new situations after they are operational without the need of taking them offline and re-training. My research investigates the role of structured representations in agent architectures with statistical learning components and how they can be manipulated or adapted efficiently on-the-fly.     

**AI Applications**: I have designed interactive, collaborative agents for a variety of domains including [patient-centric] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00234), [preventative] (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501) [healthcare] (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501), [sustainable] (https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11352) [living] (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3563357.3567404), [general] (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9515448) [purpose] (https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/viewPaper/17261) [robots](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8630/8446), and [augmented reality] (http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2327/IUI19WS-USER2AGENT-1.pdf). I am particularly motivated to build intelligent collaborative technology [social good and public welfare](https://cra.org/ccc/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/04/AI-for-Social-Good-Workshop-Report.pdf). 

My work is interdisciplinary and has been published at venues for research on artificial intelligence ([AIJ] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0004370224000973), [JAIR](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11352), [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8630/8446), [IAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI17/paper/viewPaper/14963)), human cognition ([ICCM](https://iccm-conference.github.io/), [ACS](http://cogsys.org/journal/volume2/article-2-9.pdf), [BICA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212683X14000164)), human-machine interaction ([ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3375790) [TiiS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501), [IEEE RO-MAN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9515448)) as well as in applications ([JMIR](https://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e397/), [EMBC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7591428), [ACM/AAAI AIES](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3306618.3314271)).
