I am an AI researcher at [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/). I build intelligent interactive systems that model, learn, and reason about their human collaborators. My research advances methods for complex sequential decision making, intelligent agent systems, as well as hybrid AI architectures built with statistical machine learning and knowledge-rich inference algorithms. I leverage insights from economics, psychology, education, and HCI to desgin effective and robust human-agent collaboration in real-world settings. 


I have designed collaborative agents for a variety of application domains [general](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01962) [purpose](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/viewPaper/17261) [robots](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8630/8446), [preventive](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501) [healthcare](https://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e397/), [sustainable](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11352) [transportation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3306618.3314271), and [augmented reality learning](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2327/IUI19WS-USER2AGENT-1.pdf). I am particularly motivated to build intelligent collaborative technology [social good and public welfare](https://cra.org/ccc/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/04/AI-for-Social-Good-Workshop-Report.pdf). My work is interdisciplinary and has been published at venues for research on artificial intelligence ([JAIR](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11352), [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8630/8446), [IAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IAAI/IAAI17/paper/viewPaper/14963)), human cognition ([ICCM](https://iccm-conference.github.io/), [ACS](http://cogsys.org/journal/volume2/article-2-9.pdf), [BICA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212683X14000164)), human-machine interaction ([ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3375790) [TiiS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501), [IEEE RO-MAN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9515448)) as well as in applications ([JMIR](https://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e397/), [EMBC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7591428), [ACM/AAAI AIES](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3306618.3314271)). My research has been supported by the US government (DARPA, AFOSR, ARPA-E, NSF) and commercial entities (Xerox Corporation, Kaiser Permanente). Currently, I am the principal investigator for PARC's efforts on [DARPA SAIL-ON](https://intelligencecommunitynews.com/darpa-introduces-sail-on-program/) and [DARPA GAILA](https://www.darpa.mil/program/grounded-artificial-intelligence-language-acquisition).
